# Dark Web Architecture: Layers of the Hidden Web

The dark web isn't just a place—it's an architectural feat of anonymity. In this transmission, we explore how onion routing and decentralized node networks create a digital space invisible to traditional search engines.

## The Onion Routing Protocol

Understanding the TOR network requires diving into layered encryption. Much like the layers of an onion, data is wrapped in multiple encryption levels, with each node in the relay network peeling away a single layer to find the next destination, but never the final origin.

## Peer-to-Peer Resilience

Unlike the centralized web, the dark web thrives on distributed resilience. We analyze how I2P (Invisible Internet Project) utilizes "garlic routing" to batch multiple messages together, making traffic analysis virtually impossible for standard surveillance systems.

## Architectural Implications

For a Digital Architect, the dark web serves as a case study in extreme privacy and failure-proof networking. The lessons learned here can be applied to building more secure, private-first applications in the clear web.
