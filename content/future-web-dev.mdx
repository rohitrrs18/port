# The Future of Web Development

Web development is constantly evolving. From static HTML pages to dynamic SPAs, and now to immersive 3D experiences.

## Why 3D?

3D elements add a layer of depth and interactivity that 2D interfaces simply cannot match. With libraries like **Three.js** and **React Three Fiber**, it has never been easier to integrate 3D into your web apps.

### Key Benefits

- **Engagement**: Users stay longer on sites that are visually appealing.
- **Interactivity**: 3D objects can respond to user input in natural ways.
- **Modern Feel**: It clearly signals that a brand is forward-thinking.

```javascript
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'

function App() {
  return (
    <Canvas>
      <mesh>
        <boxGeometry />
        <meshStandardMaterial />
      </mesh>
    </Canvas>
  )
}
```

This is just the beginning!
